### Introduction
----
This unit explores how indexing, query processing, and query optimization significantly enhance database performance. These topics dive into how queries are interpreted and executed efficiently, using structures like B+ Trees, hash indices, and cost-based optimizers. This unit strengthens our understanding of how data retrieval is optimized in real-world database systems.

#### Topic: Indexing and B-Tree Structures 
In Lesson 14, we were introduced to how databases use indexes to avoid scanning entire datasets when retrieving specific records.

##### Types of Indexes:

- **Ordered Indices**:<br>
Clustering (Primary): Records are stored in the same order as the index.<br>
Non-Clustering (Secondary): Records are not stored in the same order.<br>
Dense Index: Index entry for every record.<br>
Sparse Index: Index entry for some records, used only when data is sorted.<br>
- **Multilevel Index**: Indexes too large for memory are layered; outer index points to inner index.
- **Secondary Indices**: Created on non-key attributes to speed up queries beyond primary keys. <br>

##### B+ Tree and B-Tree Indexing:

B-Tree: Balanced tree allowing multiple keys per node for efficient searching. <br><br>
B+ Tree: Variation that stores data only in leaf nodes, optimized for range queries.

##### Why use B Trees? <br>
- Reduces tree height. <br>
- Minimizes disk accesses. <br>
- Efficient even as data grows. <br>

#### Topic: Query Processing and Cost Evaluation 
This lesson explained how queries written in SQL are actually processed, evaluated, and optimized behind the scenes.

##### Steps in Query Processing: 
![alt text](<../Steps in query processing.png>)
1. Parsing and Translation:<br>
Converts SQL to relational algebra.
Builds a query execution plan.

2. Evaluation:<br>
- Query plans are executed using specific algorithms.
- Pipelining can improve performance by avoiding intermediate writes.

3. Optimization:<br>
- The database selects the least-cost plan using estimates based on CPU and disk I/O.

##### Query Execution:
- Uses an iterator interface with open(), get_next(), and close() functions.

##### Cost Models:
- Traditionally based on disk I/O (blocks, seeks).
- Now consider memory and CPU due to SSD usage.

##### Join Algorithms:
- **Nested Loop Join**: Simple but expensive.
- **Block Nested Loop Join**: More efficient; processes by  blocks.
- **Indexed Nested Loop Join**: Uses indexes for lookups.
- **Merge Join**: Best when inputs are sorted.

##### Other Operations: <br>
Sorting, Projection, Set Operations, Aggregation, and Duplicate Elimination all contribute to query cost and can be optimized

#### Topic: Query Optimization Techniques 
Query optimization focuses on choosing the best execution plan from many possible ones.

##### Equivalence Rules:

- Help transform relational algebra expressions into more efficient forms.
- Examples:
    Selections and joins are commutative and associative.
    σθ1∧θ2(E) ≡ σθ1(σθ2(E))

##### Join Ordering:

- Changing the order of joins can reduce the size of intermediate results dramatically.
- Early filtering reduces computation.

##### Cost-Based Optimization:

- Evaluates the estimated cost of each execution plan.
- Uses dynamic programming to find optimal join orders.
- Considers join algorithms and statistics on data size.

##### Optimization Heuristics:

- Apply selections early.
- Use left-deep join trees for pipelining.
- Plan caching reuses plans for repeated queries.

##### Nested Subqueries:

- Subqueries can often be rewritten using joins for better performance.
- Example: Can be rewritten using a semi-join.
```sql
SELECT name FROM instructor 
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT * FROM teaches 
  WHERE instructor.ID = teaches.ID AND teaches.year = 2019
);
```

### What I learned
This unit helped me understand that performance in databases isn't just about writing the right query—it's about how the database interprets and executes it. Key takeaways include: <br>
- Indexes like B+ Trees and hashing are vital for efficient data retrieval.
- Queries go through multiple stages from parsing to optimization.
- There are different ways to execute a query, and choosing the optimal one can save massive computing resources.
- Optimization techniques can dramatically reduce query execution time and resource usage. <br>
These concepts are not only theoretical—they are the foundation for designing scalable, fast, and responsive applications in any data-driven field.
