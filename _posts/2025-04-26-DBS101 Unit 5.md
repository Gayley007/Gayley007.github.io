### Introduction
----
This unit introduces the fundamentals of good relational design, emphasizing the importance of normalization, functional dependency theory, and decomposition strategies to avoid data anomalies and ensure consistency.
Building on this foundation. It also explores through more advanced topics such as multivalued dependencies, higher normal forms like 4NF and 5NF, the significance of atomic domains for maintaining First Normal Form (1NF), and the techniques for modeling temporal data. Together, these Unit provides a comprehensive understanding of how to systematically structure and manage relational databases for real-world applications.

#### Topic: Key Principles of Database Design and Normalization
A good database design should have: <br>
- A relation for every entity, <br>
- Very few NULL values, <br>
- No spurious tuples, <br>
- No redundancy, <br>
- absolutely no modification anomalies. <br>

Lossless Decomposition - breaking down big tables into smaller ones, but it’s important that it is done carefully to avoid loss of information.

Normal Forms — which are like golden rules to make your database better. Which are: <br>
1NF (First Normal Form), <br>
2NF (Second Normal Form), <br>
3NF (Third Normal Form), <br>
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form), <br>
4NF and 5NF <br>

We need to understand how one piece of data depends on another. To do so we use things like:<br>
- Armstrong’s axioms (Reflexivity, Augmentation, and Transitivity), <br>
- Canonical covers (to remove unnecessary parts), <br>
- Dependency Preservation (to make sure we don’t lose important relationships when splitting tables). <br>

#### Topic: Advanced Database Normalization

This lesson extends the study of normalization by introducing multivalued dependencies, higher normal forms, atomic domains, and techniques for modeling temporal data.

Multivalued Dependencies (MVDs): 
- X↠Y indicates that for a given X, the set of Y values is independent of other attributes. <br>
- To eliminate such redundancies, Fourth Normal Form (4NF) is introduced.

Advanced Normal Form
Fifth Normal Form (5NF) or Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF) addresses join dependencies beyond multivalued dependencies.

Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF) considers even broader constraints but is complex and rarely used in practice.

Atomic Domains and First Normal Form (1NF):
- Attributes must have atomic (indivisible) values to satisfy 1NF.
- Non-atomic attributes, lead to redundancy and inconsistencies and should be separated into distinct attributes.

Good Database Design Process:
- It starts with a properly constructed Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram.
- Schemas can originate from E-R models
- Best practices include consistent naming, proper key placement, and sometimes controlled denormalization.

### What I learned
From this Unit, I learned the key principles of good relational database design, including minimizing null values, avoiding redundancy, and preventing anomalies through proper decomposition and normalization. I understood the importance of functional dependencies, canonical covers, and how decomposition algorithms help achieve better database structures. <br>
Additionally, I learned about multivalued dependencies and Fourth Normal Form (4NF), along with an introduction to higher normal forms like 5NF and DKNF. I also gained insights into the need for atomic domains to satisfy First Normal Form (1NF) and how to model temporal data effectively by tracking valid time periods.
