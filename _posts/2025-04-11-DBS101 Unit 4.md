### Introduction
----
In this unit we learned all about understanding how data behaves, how we interact with it, and how we can make the most of it. We explored powerful SQL concepts that enhance how we manage and retrieve information. Each lesson opened up my understanding of efficient and powerful database management.

#### Topic: Views and Indexes in SQL
This lesson focusses on views and indexes, two important SQL tools that improve our data interaction. Views are virtual tables that use pre-written queries to display data from actual tables, simplifying and securing complex data. Like a book's index, indexes facilitate faster data retrieval by establishing short lookup paths. I learnt how to optimise SQL for improved performance and easier data access by comprehending these features.

#### Topic: Authorization and Access
The significance of user control and database security was highlighted in this lesson. I discovered how SQL allows authorisation, which is the process of giving or taking away users' access privileges. To guarantee that only authorised users can read, write, or alter data, this involves establishing permissions on tables, views, or procedures. Controlling privileges is essential for maintaining private data and preserving database integrity, particularly in settings with multiple users.

#### Topic: Stored Procedures and Functions
In this lesson, I looked at using stored procedures, functions, and triggers to make SQL more reusable and dynamic. While functions return single values and can be used within queries. Stored procedures are blocks of code that can be run repeatedly with different parameters. Special procedures known as triggers run automatically in reaction to particular events, such as updates or inserts. These tools support rule enforcement, process automation, and database-based logic centralisation.

#### Topic: Recursion in SQL
In this lesson, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were used to introduce the idea of recursion. Working with hierarchical data, like organisation structures or graph paths, is made possible by recursive SQL queries, which enable a query to refer to its own output. Computing a transitive closure, which involves repeatedly joining data to infer indirect relationships, is a typical use case. Despite their strength, recursive queries have limitations to ensure accuracy and efficiency. For example, they must refrain from aggregation or non-monotonic operations within their recursive sections.

#### What I Learned
I now have a far greater understanding of SQL's capabilities thanks to these four lessons. It involves more than just data retrieval; it involves developing intelligent, reusable, and effective systems. I discovered how recursion allows us to elegantly explore relationships within data, how triggers can enforce rules, how stored procedures and functions can organise logic, and how views can abstract complexity.

I have gained the ability to extend beyond the fundamentals of SQL to practical database administration thanks to these classes. My confidence in creating intelligent, scalable systems that leverage data has increased.
