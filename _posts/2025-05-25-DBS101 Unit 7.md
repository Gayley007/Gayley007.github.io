### Introduction
----
Unit 7 of the Database Systems course introduces the foundational principles that govern the reliability and consistency of modern databases. It focuses on transactions, concurrency control, and recovery mechanisms, emphasizing how database systems ensure correctness and robustness even under system failures or concurrent user activity. This unit not only equips learners with theoretical knowledge but also presents practical SQL examples and real-world scenarios to understand how databases maintain integrity under pressure.

#### Topic: Transactions and the ACID Properties
This lesson introduces the concept of transactions as units of work that must either complete fully or not at all. To ensure this, databases rely on the ACID properties, 
which are:
- **Atomicity** ensures either all operations happen or none do.
- **Consistency** keeps the database in a valid state.
- **Isolation** prevents concurrent transactions from interfering.
- **Durability** ensures changes are saved, even after crashes.

It explains how systems handle failures by rolling back or redoing transactions and illustrates these mechanisms with SQL transaction examples like transferring money between accounts. 

#### Topic: Locking and Concurrency Control
It explores how locking mechanisms are used to enforce isolation in multi-user database environments. 
**Key concepts** 
- Shared and exclusive locks
- Two-phase locking (2PL)
- Strategies to handle deadlocks. 
- timestamp ordering and multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). 
It also touches on practical issues like lock granularity, lock escalation, and phantom reads, offering insights into how databases balance concurrency with consistency.

#### Topic: Database Recovery Mechanisms
We learn about database recovery, which is essential for restoring data integrity after failures like crashes or corruption. 
- It introduces log-based recovery, focusing on undo and redo operations using log records that track all changes. <br>
Concepts like 
- checkpoints, 
- fuzzy checkpoints, and 
- write-ahead logging (WAL) 
are discussed for efficient recovery. 

The lesson also presents the ARIES recovery algorithm, a robust 3-phase approach (Analysis, Redo, Undo). 
Lastly, it explores high availability through remote backups and recovery techniques for main-memory databases, emphasizing speed and fault tolerance.

#### What I Learned
This unit taught me that **database systems are not just about storing data**, but about making sure that data is safe, reliable, and consistent, no matter what happens. <br>
key takeaways:
- **Why transactions are critical** and how they ensure consistent results.
- **How concurrency control works** to balance multiple users.
- **How recovery techniques like ARIES and WAL protect data** during system failures.

Understanding these principles matters because almost every real-world system (banking, e-commerce, healthcare) relies on **strong data integrity** and **fault tolerance**. This unit gave me the knowledge to be able to build and maintain systems that users can trust.
